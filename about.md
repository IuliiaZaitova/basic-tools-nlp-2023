## About


This course covers the basic technical tools and skills required mainly for LST Master's students. Here you can learn about *nix systems, Bash commands, Vim text editor, Git for version control, Python, and cluster computing. The course also covers LaTeX and reference management tools. It would be especially useful for those coming from non-technical background.
