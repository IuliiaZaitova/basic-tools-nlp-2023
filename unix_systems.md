## Overview

Introduction to *nix Systems

In this week's session, we delved into the basics of *nix systems. Here are the [slides](https://github.com/pyRis/basic-tools-for-NLP/blob/main/linux/slides_week2.pdf)
 used in class.

### Commands Covered

We went through several commands used in *nix systems, including:

* `cd \` - change directory to root
* `cd` - change directory to home
* `ls` - list files and directories
* `ls -l` - list files and directories in long format
* `ls -a` - list all files and directories, including hidden files
* `whoami` - display the username of the current user
* `id` - display user id, username, and group membership information
* `tree -L...` - lists the files and directories in the current working directory recursively up to a specified level
* `passwd` - change password
* `rm` - remove file
* `chmod` - change file permissions. For more information, check out this [guide](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/it-ops/linux-file-permissions).
