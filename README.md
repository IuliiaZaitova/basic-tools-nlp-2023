## :exclamation: Note for 30.10 lecture:

Please join [the course on Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aw6oYs2R1p0qmc_9m2vA3czFFW8MVSNl-Sn9AlWr8meI1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=8eaf1e42-6bed-400b-95a4-d54b25688dca&tenantId=67610027-1ac3-49b6-8641-ccd83ce1b01f)!

For our upcoming classes, you will need a *nix-based system (Linux or Mac) and Git. We kindly ask that you try to install these before the class on November 6th. If you would like to install Linux, we would highly recommend the Ubuntu distribution. Refer to [this guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) for Ubuntu installation (please note that you will need a flash drive with a capacity of 12GB or more). If, for any reason, you wish to continue using Microsoft Windows, you can find instructions on how to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Git is typically pre-installed on most Mac and Linux machines.

Should you encounter any issues while installing Linux, WSL, or Git, please don't worryâ€”during the last 30 minutes of the class on October 30th, we will be available to assist you with troubleshooting your installations. Hope to see you on Monday! :blush:

## About


This course covers the basic technical tools and skills required mainly for LST Master's students. Here you can learn about *nix systems, Bash commands, Vim text editor, Git for version control, Python, and cluster computing. We will also cover LaTeX and reference management tools. It would be especially useful for those coming from non-technical background.

## Laptop Policy

Please **do bring laptops to lecture**. In this class we will do a lot practical exercises on the computer, so it is essential to have a working laptop with a *nix system on it (e.g. Linux or MacOS).


Slides would be available just before the lectures, so that you can download them during the class :)


## Homework

After the assignments are out, you have **one week** (before the next class) to complete them. You can get up to 3 points for each assignment.
