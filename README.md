## About


This course covers the basic technical tools and skills required mainly for LST Master's students. Here you can learn about *nix systems, Bash commands, Vim text editor, Git for version control, Python, and cluster computing. We will also cover LaTeX and reference management tools. It would be especially useful for those coming from non-technical background.

## Laptop Policy

Please **do bring laptops to lecture**. In this class we will do a lot practical exercises on the computer, so it is essential to have a working laptop with a *nix system on it (e.g. Linux or MacOS).


## Homework

After the assignments are out, you have **one week** (before the next class) to complete them. You can get up to 3 points for each assignment.
